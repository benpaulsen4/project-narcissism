# Project Narcissism

## A personal portfolio website by Ben Paulsen

This app is built in NextJS 13 making full use of the new Apps directory which will form the next generation of fluid
and regenerative Next apps, based on React server. As this feature is currently in beta, some features (like a custom
404 page) are not available. As the app directory exits beta I will update node modules to get the production version.

## Current App Version

The current version is **Beta v2.5** At this time, the app is pretty much complete - the only remaining tasks are polish
and admin related. The site will be published through Railway, which will provide CI/CD and hosting.
