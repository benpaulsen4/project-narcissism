# Project Narcissism
## A personal portfolio website by Ben Paulsen

This app is built in NextJS 13 making full use of the new Apps directory which will form the next generation of fluid
and regenerative Next apps, based on React server. As this feature is currently in beta, some features (like a custom
404 page) are not available. As the app directory exits beta I will update node modules to get the production version.


## Current App Version

The current version is **Beta v0.9**, which represents the first published version for testing purposes. At this time,
the app is still incomplete. Beta 1 will be the first complete version of the site, which will begin with only desktop
support. The site will be published through Railway, which will provide CI/CD and hosting.
