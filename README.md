# Project Narcissism

## A personal portfolio website by Ben Paulsen

This app is built in NextJS 13 making full use of the new Apps directory-based routing which will form the next
generation of fluid and regenerative Next apps, based on React server. Not only does this bring performance improvements
and reduce the JS bundle size sent to the browser, but it greatly improves SEO performance of relatively static sites
like this one. As the app directory exits beta I will update node modules to get the production version.

## Current App Version

The current version is **Release v3.0**. This is the first release version of the website. The site is published through
Railway, which provides CI/CD and hosting, and a Cloudflare proxy for performance and DDOS protection. Firebase is used
for analytics as well as to provide basic database functions for notifications.

~~TODOs for Realease v3:~~

- [x] Add more, fancier animations and visual flaire
- [x] Perform final polish, including planning for potential new features
- [x] Purchase and activate professional domain name
- [x] Google search console
- [x] Update Next version to latest
- [x] Remove beta message and make content tweaks

TODOs for Release v3.1:

- [ ] Update Next once app routing is marked stable
