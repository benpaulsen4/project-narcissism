# Project Narcissism

## A personal portfolio website by Ben Paulsen

This app is built in NextJS 13 making full use of the new Apps directory-based routing which will form the next
generation of fluid and regenerative Next apps, based on React server. Not only does this bring performance improvements
and reduce the JS bundle size sent to the browser, but it greatly improves SEO performance of relatively static sites
like this one.

## Current App Version

The current version is **Release v3.2**. The site is published through Railway, which provides CI/CD and hosting, and a
Cloudflare proxy for performance and DDOS protection. Firebase is used for analytics as well as to provide basic
database functions for notifications.
